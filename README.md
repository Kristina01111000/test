# test
testing computer commits

currently: can't get git bash to pickup the file on my computer

look @ code academy listing

figure it out before the next git class

- using notepad ++
- using the email that github makes for me instead of real email
- make a copy of git commands
- https://training.github.com/ for pdf

git bash works, can find the site, but cannot make changes to it
